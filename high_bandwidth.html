                    <p>The title says it all. We had some great applications for cities to host <a href="http://us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a> after we finish up in Philadelphia this year, and the city chosen for 2017-2018 is <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Based on the other great applications we got I’m also excited about the pipeline of communities that could host it in future years as WordCamp US travels across the United States and gives us an opportunity to learn and love a new city, as we have with Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>By the way, if you haven’t yet, now is a great time to <a href="https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2016-survey">take the Annual WordPress Survey</a> and ask your friends to as well.</p>

                    <p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 3 is now available!</p>
                    <p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.7, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7-beta3.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
                    <p>For more information on what’s new in 4.7, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/">Beta 1</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-2/">Beta 2</a> blog posts, along with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-7+dev-notes/">in-depth field guides on make/core</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 3 include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>REST API:</strong> The <code>unfiltered_html</code> capability is now respected and <code>rest_base</code> has been added to response objects of <code>wp/v2/taxonomies</code> and <code>wp/v2/types</code>, while <code>get_allowed_query_vars()</code> and the <code>rest_get_post</code> filter have been removed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Roles/Capabilities:</strong> Added meta-caps for comment, term, and user meta, which are currently only used in the REST API.</li>
                        <li><strong>I18N:</strong> Added the ability to change user’s locale back to site’s locale. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38632">#38632</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Custom CSS:</strong> Renamed the <code>unfiltered_css</code> meta capability to <code>edit_css</code> and added revisions support to the <code>custom_css</code> post type.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edit shortcuts:</strong> Theme authors should take a look at <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">the developer guide to the customizer preview’s visible edit shortcuts</a> and update their themes to take advantage of them if not already implementing selective refresh.</li>
                        <li><strong>Various bug fixes:</strong> We’ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=39200&amp;stop_rev=39143&amp;limit=200&amp;verbose=on&amp;sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=">over 50 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

                <h2 class="fancy"><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/">WordPress 4.7 Beta 1</a></h2>

                <div class="meta">Posted October 28, 2016 by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/helen">Helen Hou-Sandi</a>. Filed under <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/development/" rel="category tag">Development</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/" rel="category tag">Releases</a>. </div>
                <div class="storycontent">
                    <p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
                    <p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.7, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
                    <p>WordPress 4.7 is slated for release on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/">December 6</a>, but we need your help to get there. We’ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://2017.wordpress.net/"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> – A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Video Headers</strong> – Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> – From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you’re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it’s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We’ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> – Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won’t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>
                        <li><strong>User admin languages</strong> – Just because your site is in one language doesn’t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you’ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>
                        <li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> – Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> – If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them? (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38373">#38373</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong><code>WP_Hook</code></strong> – The code that lies beneath actions and filters has been overhauled. You likely aren’t affected, but if you’ve done things to the <code>$wp_filter</code> global or experienced funky recursion bugs in the past, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/">please take a moment to read the dev note</a> and test your code.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/04/custom-bulk-actions/"><strong>Custom bulk actions</strong></a> – List tables, now with more than bulk edit and delete.</li>
                        <li>Expanded <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/26/registering-your-settings-in-wordpress-4-7/"><strong>Settings Registration API</strong></a> via&nbsp;<code>register_setting()</code>.</li>
                        <li>For theme developers: <strong>Post type templates</strong> (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18375">#18375</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/new-functions-hooks-and-behaviour-for-theme-developers-in-wordpress-4-7/">More goodies for theme developers!</a></strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Locale switching</strong> (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26511">#26511</a>)</li>
                        <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/11/comment-allowed-checks-in-wordpress-4-7/"><strong>Comment allowed checks</strong></a> have the potential for a back-compat break.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you want a more in-depth view of what major changes have made it into 4.7, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-7/">check out posts tagged with 4.7 on the main development blog</a>, or look at a&nbsp;<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=4.7&amp;group=component&amp;order=priority">list of everything</a>&nbsp;that’s changed. There will be more developer notes to come, so keep an eye out for those as well.</p>

                    <p>Translating is one of the easiest ways to get involved with WordPress and contribute to&nbsp;the project.&nbsp;Global WordPress Translation Day is your chance to learn more about translating WordPress, meet people from all over the world, and&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams">translate WordPress into one of more than 160&nbsp;languages</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Join us on November 12th from anywhere&nbsp;in the world</h3>
                    <p>The translation day&nbsp;starts on Saturday, November 12th, 2016, at&nbsp;0:00 UTC and ends 24 hours later.&nbsp;<a href="http://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2016-11-12/00:00/Global%20WordPress%20Translation%20Day%202">See what time that is for you!</a>&nbsp;You can join right from the start,&nbsp;or any time it’s convenient for you throughout the day.</p>
                    <h3>What are we doing?</h3>
                    <p>Local contributor days are happening all over the world, and are a great way to get involved. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=12Gni4JMfShyWHPqGNwh5-PMneMM&amp;usp=sharing">Check out this map</a> to see if there’s already a local event happening near you. Can’t find one?&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2016/09/22/global-wordpress-translation-day-2-on-november-12th-2016/">Organize a local event!</a></p>
                    <p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/gwtd2/register">join the community for 24 hours of live-streamed, remote sessions</a> in numerous languages. Sessions will cover localization, internationalization, and contributing in your language.</p>
                    <h3>Who’s it for?</h3>
                    <p>Whether you’re new to translating and want to learn how to translate, or an experienced translation editor building a strong team, the translation day is for <i>you</i>. Developers will also enjoy topics from experienced contributors, whether you’re learning about internationalization and or want to find more translators for your themes and plugins. There’s a session for everyone!</p>
                    <h3>Get Involved</h3>
                    <p>Joining is easy! On November 12th, in your own timezone, <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org">translate WordPress</a> or your favorite plugins and themes into your language, while watching live sessions over the course of the day.</p>
                    <p>Want&nbsp;to get more involved? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2016/09/22/global-wordpress-translation-day-2-on-november-12th-2016/">Sign up to organize a local event</a> and invite your local community to translate together on November 12th. Events can be formal or completely informal&nbsp;– grab your laptop and a couple of friends, and head to a local coffee shop to translate for an hour or two.</p>
                    <h3>Can you&nbsp;get involved if you only speak English?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! Even if you only speak English, there are great sessions about internationalization that can benefit every developer. There’s also lots of English variants that need your help! For example, English is spoken and written differently in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. You can learn about these differences and why these variants are important during the sessions.</p>
                    <p>And if you’re feeling fun, try translating WordPress into emoji! Yep, we have a translation of WordPress in emoji! <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🌎" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/1f30e.svg"><img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🌍" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/1f30d.svg"><img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🌏" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/1f30f.svg"></p>

                    <p>Thank you to the&nbsp;reporters for practicing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a>.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.6.1 fixes 15 bugs from 4.6.&nbsp;For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.6.1">release notes</a>&nbsp;or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=4.6.1">list of changes</a>.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/resource-hints-in-4-6/">Resource hints help browsers</a> decide which resources to fetch and preprocess. WordPress 4.6 adds them automatically for your styles and scripts making your site even faster.</p>
                    <h3>Robust Requests</h3>
                    <p>The HTTP API now leverages the Requests library, improving HTTP standard support and adding case-insensitive headers, parallel HTTP requests, and support for Internationalized Domain Names.</p>
                    <h3><code>WP_Term_Query</code> and <code>WP_Post_Type</code></h3>
                    <p>A new <code><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_term_query">WP_Term_Query</a></code> class adds flexibility to query term information while a new <code><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_post_type">WP_Post_Type</a></code> object makes interacting with post types more predictable.</p>
                    <h3>Meta Registration API</h3>
                    <p>The Meta Registration API <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/08/enhancing-register_meta-in-4-6/">has been expanded</a> to support types, descriptions, and REST API visibility.</p>
                    <h3>Translations On Demand</h3>
                    <p>WordPress will install and use the newest language packs for your plugins and themes as soon as they’re available from <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">WordPress.org’s community of translators</a>.</p>
                    <h3>JavaScript Library Updates</h3>
                    <p>Masonry 3.3.2, imagesLoaded 3.2.0, MediaElement.js 2.22.0, TinyMCE 4.4.1, and Backbone.js 1.3.3 are bundled.</p>
                    <h3>Customizer APIs for Setting Validation and Notifications</h3>
                    <p>Settings now have an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/05/customizer-apis-in-4-6-for-setting-validation-and-notifications/">API for enforcing validation constraints</a>. Likewise, customizer controls now support notifications, which are used to display validation errors instead of failing silently.</p>
                    <h3>Multisite, now faster than ever</h3>
                    <p>Cached and comprehensive site queries improve your network admin experience. The addition of <code><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_site_query">WP_Site_Query</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_network_query">WP_Network_Query</a></code> help craft advanced queries with less effort.</p>

                    <p>The second release candidate for WordPress 4.6 is now available.</p>
                    <p>We’ve made over <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.6/src?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=follow_copy&amp;rev=38246&amp;stop_rev=38170&amp;limit=200&amp;verbose=on&amp;sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=">30 changes</a> since the first release candidate. RC means we think we’re done, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible we’ve missed something. We hope to ship WordPress 4.6 on <strong>Tuesday, August 16</strong>, but we need <em>your</em> help to get there.</p>
                    <p>If you haven’t tested 4.6 yet, now is the time!</p>
                    <p><strong>Think you’ve found a bug?</strong> Please post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">Alpha/Beta support forum</a>. If any known issues come up, you’ll be able to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">find them here</a>.</p>
                    <p>To test WordPress 4.6, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.6-RC2.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>
                    <p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.6, check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/06/wordpress-4-6-beta-1/">Beta 1</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/07/wordpress-4-6-beta-2/">Beta 2</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/07/wordpress-4-6-beta-3/">Beta 3</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/07/wordpress-4-6-beta-4/">Beta 4</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/07/wordpress-4-6-release-candidate/">RC 1</a> blog posts.</p>
                    <p>A few changes of note since the first release candidate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support for custom HTTP methods and proxy authentication has been restored.</li>
                        <li>Various fixes for the streamlined updates, including better failure messages and error handling, basic back-compat styling for custom update notifications, and additional and standardized JavaScript events.</li>
                        <li>Unnecessary reference parameters have been removed from new multisite functions.</li>
                        <li>A compatibility issue with PHP 7.0.9 (and PHP 7.1) has been fixed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Developers</strong>, please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 4.6 and update your plugin’s <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 4.6. If you find compatibility problems please be sure to post to the support forums so we can figure those out before the final release – we never want to break things.</p>

We hope to ship WordPress 4.6 on <strong>Tuesday, August&nbsp;16</strong>, but we need <em>your</em> help to get there.</p>
                    <p>If you haven’t tested 4.6 yet, now is the time!</p>
                    <p><strong>Think you’ve found a bug?</strong> Please post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">Alpha/Beta support forum</a>. If any known issues come up, you’ll be able to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">find them here</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Developers</strong>, please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 4.6 and update your plugin’s <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 4.6.

                    <p>WordPress 4.6 Beta 4 is now available!</p>
                    <p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Media</strong>: <code>alt</code> attributes are now always added to images inserted from URLs (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36735">#36735</a>).</li>

                        <li>The media player <strong>MediaElement.js</strong> has been updated to 2.22.0 to fix YouTube video embeds (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37363">#37363</a>).</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Import screen</strong> was overhauled, improving accessibility and making it much easier to install and run an importer (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35191">#35191</a>).</li>

                            <p>Chen-Hao Hsu acquired his first orchids at the age of ten while living in Taiwan. &nbsp;Prior to studying ecology and statistics at UC Davis graduate school, he interned one summer at Longwood Gardens outside of Philadelphia and worked briefly with the orchid collection there. Currently, his travels for work and pleasure have led him to many destinations in the US and abroad. His recent travels have included Mexico, Peru, central Africa, Brazil and Ecuador where he observed a variety of orchids and other plants growing in vastly different habitats.</p>

                            <p>Have you ever wondered why your plant has a sudden burst of growth after transplanting? Or how the plant “knows” to&nbsp;grow new parts when pruned or how a cutting knows to make roots? Find answers to these questions and others about&nbsp;why your plants grow the way they do during this informative but not so technical presentation by Ernesto Sandoval,&nbsp;Director of the UC Davis Botanical Conservatory.<strong><em><br>

                            <p>Alfred Hockenmaier&nbsp;has been growing orchids for about 20 years. &nbsp;He got the ‘orchid bug’ when he began working at a rare and unusual plant nursery called The Plant Shop’s Botanical Gardens in the San Fernando Valley.&nbsp; One thing led to another and Alfred now maintains a mixed collection in two greenhouses as well as an outdoor shade area.&nbsp; His talk is a step-by-step demonstration on how to mount orchids in addition to culture and care for mounted orchids.&nbsp; After all, it’s one of the most natural ways to grow them!</p>

                                In the home, the most familiar way of keeping a plant is potted in a planter. But the possibilities for indoor plant arrangements are quite broad, especially when you introduce the idea of mounting plants. Suddenly, wall space becomes plant space! We mount a wide array of tropical plants to cork, using sphagnum moss and a touch of soil. The...

                                Ever wondered how to make a kokedama? It's easy! Kokedama, sometimes called string gardens or Japanese moss balls, are a form of bonsai that dates back to the Edo era in Japan, circa 1600. Kokedama are just as beautiful to look at as they are fun to make, and thrive indoors - perfect for a corner nook in a small...

                                Kokedama is a traditional Japanese bonsai form in which the roots of plants are bound with spaghnum moss into living 'string gardens.' While tropical plants, ferns and jungle cacti adapt well to kokedama, a surprising range of plants can be made into these living moss balls. Scented Geraniums, also known as pelargonium, make a wonderful indoor-outdoor kokedama that will continue...

                                Kokedama is a Japanese word that, simply translated, means “moss ball”. Sometimes called the “Poor Man’s Bonsai” or “string gardens,” the of art of binding plants into green, mossy orbs dates back centuries to the Edo era in Japan (around 1600 AD). Making kokedama is a fun process that involves stripping soil from the plant's roots, and using a special-clayrich...

                                The idea of a “jungle cactus” sounds like a contradiction at first. Jungles are hot, humid, lush and green, and cacti grow in the arid, sun-scorched desert. Jungle cactus? How’s that supposed to work? Like most things in the plant world, it’s not so black and white, and there are various genera&nbsp;of cacti that thrive in the shady moist canopy...

And still other plants can grow epiphytically when specially propagated and given a specific growing environment. This is where our epiphytic wall plaques come in. Like tiny swatches of flora...

                                It’s a fact: staghorn ferns are stunning. Mounted on a board, wrapped in vintage burlap, and hung a wall, these plants are truly works of living art. There are dozens of species of staghorn ferns, and until recently, they were quite rare. Now though--thanks to species native to Australia, Platycerium bifurcatum, that is relatively easy to care for and propagate--they’re...

                            <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>
                            <p>Air plants are some of our very favorites; they are stunning as <a title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants">standalone pieces</a>, and we feature them in many of our <a title="Living Art - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art">Living Art</a> pieces, such as <a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a> and <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounts</a>.</p>
                            <p>Here are the best practices we recommend for air plant care. First we’ll talk about how to care for air plants in general, and then we’ll talk about adaptations in air plant care for aeriums, terrariums and mounted tillandsia.</p>

                            <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                            <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                            <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                            <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                            <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                            <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                            <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                            <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                            <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                            <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                            <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                            <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                            <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul></ul>
                            <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                            <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                            <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                            <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                            <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                            <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                            <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                            <p><strong>How to Care For Air Plants in Aeriums and Terrariums</strong></p>
                            <p><a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/air-plants" title="Air Plants and Aeriums - Shop Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/aeriums-and-terrariums.jpg?2106" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="Aeriums and Terrariums at Pistils Nursery" align="right"></a></p>
                            <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                            <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                </li>
                                <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>How to Care for Mounted Air Plants</strong></p>
                            <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>
                            <p><em>Follow these air plant care guidelines, and you should see your Tillandsia thriving in no time! Have any questions or your own best practices for air plant care? Share with us in the comments!</em></p>

                                <div><p>Hey! I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                <div><p>@Hayley – I think you’re right that the thinner, frizzier varieties tend to be a bit fussier and more susceptible to rot. I’d say if misting is working for you, stick with that!</p>

                                <div><p>@Dan – congrats! Your plant has reached maturity and flowered. They can look quite amazing during this. The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

                                <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                    <p>Hope this helps,<br>

                                <div><p>@Laura – unfortunately these plants are highly susceptible to rot, and even being over-watered once is enough to trigger it. If the plant is falling apart, it’s probably not able to be saved. So sorry!</p>

                                <div><p>@Madelyn – Sorry to hear that! You could try fertilizing, which might increase the chances of pups, but it’s hard to say for sure.</p>

                                <div><p>@Verna – Sounds lovely! The color will probably fade after the bloom a bit, yes, but the bloom itself can last quite some time. Enjoy!</p>

                                    my tectorum  is getting dark colored  tips does it need more light or water ? I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

                                <div><p>I’ve had my air plant for almost five months now, and everything was going fine. However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

                                <div><p>@Candra – there are many, many cultivars of air plants. I’m guessing you have a real one that might just be harder to find!

                                <div><p>@Kelsey- Yikes! Sorry to hear about the mix-up. I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

                                <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                <div><p>I bought my first air plant yesterday from a pharmacy store and it was glued to the glass container it came with. The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

                                <div><p>@Corky – I think you can definitely hang it from your ceiling! I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                <div><p>@ Cr8zyC8tL8dy – No shame on plant addiction! We’ve all been there (most of us still are there) and there’s something really satisfying about keeping these guys in your home and creating a bit of the tropics.</p>
                                    <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                    <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you. Check it out at: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                <div><p>I moved into my first apartment with all these windows (facing east) and became addicted to air plants. I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

                                <div><p>@Steph – Congrats on your air plant baby, otherwise known as a “pup!” How big was the mother plant? Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>
                                    <p>In the case that it separated prematurely, I’d just do your best to be attentive to its needs, taking care not to over-or-under water, and making sure it gets bright, indirect light.</p>
                                    <p>Best of luck!<br>

                                <div><p>@Emme – Congrats on your first air plant! These guys are very versatile, and the assembly can go a number of ways depending on your aesthetic preferences.</p>
                                    <p>Generally, we recommend starting with sand/gravel and adding the larger items as you go, finishing with moss. Yes, the air plant goes in the container, but it simply rests on the surface of the stones. You don’t need to bury or “plant” it at all. Here’s a link to our aeriums as a reference: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/aerium</p>

And does the air plant actually go into the container?  Just need some extra explanation please.  Emme</p></div>

                                    <p><strong>The name “<a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery">air plant</a>” is actually a bit misleading. Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                    <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>
                                    <p>Air plants are some of our very favorites; they are stunning as <a title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants">standalone pieces</a>, and we feature them in many of our <a title="Living Art - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art">Living Art</a> pieces, such as <a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a> and <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounts</a>.</p>
                                    <p>Here are the best practices we recommend for air plant care. First we’ll talk about how to care for air plants in general, and then we’ll talk about adaptations in air plant care for aeriums, terrariums and mounted tillandsia.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                    <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                    <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                    <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                    <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                    <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                    <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                    <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>

                                    <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                    <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                    <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                    <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                        <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                        <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                        <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                        <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                        <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                        <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul></ul>
                                    <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                    <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                    <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                    <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                    <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                    <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                    <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                    <p><strong>How to Care For Air Plants in Aeriums and Terrariums</strong></p>
                                    <p><a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/air-plants" title="Air Plants and Aeriums - Shop Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/aeriums-and-terrariums.jpg?2106" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="Aeriums and Terrariums at Pistils Nursery" align="right"></a></p>
                                    <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                    <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                    <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                        <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                        <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                        <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                        <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                        <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>How to Care for Mounted Air Plants</strong></p>
                                    <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>
                                    <p><em>Follow these air plant care guidelines, and you should see your Tillandsia thriving in no time! Have any questions or your own best practices for air plant care? Share with us in the comments!</em></p>

                                    <div><p>Hey! I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                    <div><p>@Hayley – I think you’re right that the thinner, frizzier varieties tend to be a bit fussier and more susceptible to rot. I’d say if misting is working for you, stick with that!</p>

                                    <div><p>@Dan – congrats! Your plant has reached maturity and flowered. They can look quite amazing during this. The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

                                    <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                    <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                        <p>Hope this helps,<br>

                                    <div><p>@Laura – unfortunately these plants are highly susceptible to rot, and even being over-watered once is enough to trigger it. If the plant is falling apart, it’s probably not able to be saved. So sorry!</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

                                    <div><p>@Kelsey- Yikes! Sorry to hear about the mix-up. I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                    <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

                                    <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                    <div><p>I bought my first air plant yesterday from a pharmacy store and it was glued to the glass container it came with. The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

                                    <div><p>@Corky – I think you can definitely hang it from your ceiling! I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>
                                        <p>Hope this helps!<br>

                                    <div><p>@ Cr8zyC8tL8dy – No shame on plant addiction! We’ve all been there (most of us still are there) and there’s something really satisfying about keeping these guys in your home and creating a bit of the tropics.</p>
                                        <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                        <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you. Check it out at: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>
                                        <p>Hope this helps!<br>

                                    <div><p>I moved into my first apartment with all these windows (facing east) and became addicted to air plants. I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

                                    <div><p>@Steph – Congrats on your air plant baby, otherwise known as a “pup!” How big was the mother plant? Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>
                                        <p>In the case that it separated prematurely, I’d just do your best to be attentive to its needs, taking care not to over-or-under water, and making sure it gets bright, indirect light.</p>
                                        <p>Best of luck!<br>

                                    <div><p>@Emme – Congrats on your first air plant! These guys are very versatile, and the assembly can go a number of ways depending on your aesthetic preferences.</p>
                                        <p>Generally, we recommend starting with sand/gravel and adding the larger items as you go, finishing with moss. Yes, the air plant goes in the container, but it simply rests on the surface of the stones. You don’t need to bury or “plant” it at all. Here’s a link to our aeriums as a reference: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/aerium</p>

We are confused as to the order of the packets we have to go into the glass container.  We have assembly direction, but not sure which goes where.  There is a packet with rock and moss and also a packet with fine grain gravel material. And does the air plant actually go into the container?  Just need some extra explanation please.

                                        <p><strong>The name “<a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery">air plant</a>” is actually a bit misleading. Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                        <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>
                                        <p>Air plants are some of our very favorites; they are stunning as <a title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants">standalone pieces</a>, and we feature them in many of our <a title="Living Art - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art">Living Art</a> pieces, such as <a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a> and <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounts</a>.</p>
                                        <p>Here are the best practices we recommend for air plant care. First we’ll talk about how to care for air plants in general, and then we’ll talk about adaptations in air plant care for aeriums, terrariums and mounted tillandsia.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                        <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                        <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                        <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                        <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                        <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                        <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                        <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                        <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                        <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                        <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                        <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                            <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                            <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                            <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                            <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                            <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                            <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <ul></ul>
                                        <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                        <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                        <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                        <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                        <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                        <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                        <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                        <p><strong>How to Care For Air Plants in Aeriums and Terrariums</strong></p>
                                        <p><a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/air-plants" title="Air Plants and Aeriums - Shop Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/aeriums-and-terrariums.jpg?2106" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="Aeriums and Terrariums at Pistils Nursery" align="right"></a></p>
                                        <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                        <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                        <br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                            <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                            <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                            <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                            <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                            <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p><strong>How to Care for Mounted Air Plants</strong></p>
                                        <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>
                                        <p><em>Follow these air plant care guidelines, and you should see your Tillandsia thriving in no time! Have any questions or your own best practices for air plant care? Share with us in the comments!</em></p>

                                        <div><p>Hey! I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                        <div><p>@Hayley – I think you’re right that the thinner, frizzier varieties tend to be a bit fussier and more susceptible to rot. I’d say if misting is working for you, stick with that!</p>

                                        <div><p>@Dan – congrats! Your plant has reached maturity and flowered. They can look quite amazing during this. The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

                                        <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                        <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                            <p>Hope this helps,<br>

                                        <div><p>@Laura – unfortunately these plants are highly susceptible to rot, and even being over-watered once is enough to trigger it. If the plant is falling apart, it’s probably not able to be saved. So sorry!</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

                                        <div><p>@Kelsey- Yikes! Sorry to hear about the mix-up. I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                        <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>
                                            <p>All the best,<br>

                                        <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                        <div><p>I bought my first air plant yesterday from a pharmacy store and it was glued to the glass container it came with. The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

                                        <div><p>@Corky – I think you can definitely hang it from your ceiling! I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                        <div><p>@ Cr8zyC8tL8dy – No shame on plant addiction! We’ve all been there (most of us still are there) and there’s something really satisfying about keeping these guys in your home and creating a bit of the tropics.</p>
                                            <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                            <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you. Check it out at: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                        <div><p>I moved into my first apartment with all these windows (facing east) and became addicted to air plants. I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

                                        <div><p>@Steph – Congrats on your air plant baby, otherwise known as a “pup!” How big was the mother plant? Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>
                                            <p>In the case that it separated prematurely, I’d just do your best to be attentive to its needs, taking care not to over-or-under water, and making sure it gets bright, indirect light.</p>
                                            <p>Best of luck!<br>

                                        <div><p>@Emme – Congrats on your first air plant! These guys are very versatile, and the assembly can go a number of ways depending on your aesthetic preferences.</p>
                                            <p>Generally, we recommend starting with sand/gravel and adding the larger items as you go, finishing with moss. Yes, the air plant goes in the container, but it simply rests on the surface of the stones. You don’t need to bury or “plant” it at all. Here’s a link to our aeriums as a reference: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/aerium</p>

Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                            <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>
                                            <p>Air plants are some of our very favorites; they are stunning as <a title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants">standalone pieces</a>, and we feature them in many of our <a title="Living Art - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art">Living Art</a> pieces, such as <a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a> and <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounts</a>.</p>
                                            <p>Here are the best practices we recommend for air plant care. First we’ll talk about how to care for air plants in general, and then we’ll talk about adaptations in air plant care for aeriums, terrariums and mounted tillandsia.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                            <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                            <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                            <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                            <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                            <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                            <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                            <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                            <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                            <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                            <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                            <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <ul></ul>
                                            <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                            <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                            <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                            <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                            <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                            <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                            <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                            <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                            <p><strong>How to Care For Air Plants in Aeriums and Terrariums</strong></p>
                                            <p><a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/air-plants" title="Air Plants and Aeriums - Shop Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/aeriums-and-terrariums.jpg?2106" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="Aeriums and Terrariums at Pistils Nursery" align="right"></a></p>
                                            <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                            <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                            <br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                                <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                                <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                                <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                                <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p><strong>How to Care for Mounted Air Plants</strong></p>
                                            <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>

                                            <div><p>Hey! I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                            <div><p>@Dan – congrats! Your plant has reached maturity and flowered. They can look quite amazing during this. The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

                                            <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                            <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                                <p>Hope this helps,<br>

                                            <div><p>@Laura – unfortunately these plants are highly susceptible to rot, and even being over-watered once is enough to trigger it. If the plant is falling apart, it’s probably not able to be saved. So sorry!</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

Is it possible I fell for a sales gimmick? <br>
                                                It’s still healthy though, the smallest plant I’ve ever gotten. It takes water really well and doesn’t seem bothered if it was dyed.</p></div>

                                            <div><p>@Kelsey- Yikes! Sorry to hear about the mix-up. I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                            <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

                                            <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                            <div><p>@ Cr8zyC8tL8dy – No shame on plant addiction! We’ve all been there (most of us still are there) and there’s something really satisfying about keeping these guys in your home and creating a bit of the tropics.</p>
                                                <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                                <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you. Check it out at: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                            <div><p>I moved into my first apartment with all these windows (facing east) and became addicted to air plants. I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>

Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                                <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                                <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                                <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                                <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                                <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                                <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                                <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                                <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                                <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                                <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                                <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                                <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                    <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                    <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                    <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                    <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                    <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                    <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <ul></ul>
                                                <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                                <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                                <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                                <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                                <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                                <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                                <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                                <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                                <p><strong>How to Care For Air Plants in Aeriums and Terrariums</strong></p>
                                                <p><a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/air-plants" title="Air Plants and Aeriums - Shop Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/aeriums-and-terrariums.jpg?2106" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="Aeriums and Terrariums at Pistils Nursery" align="right"></a></p>
                                                <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                                <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                <br>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                                    <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                    <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                                    <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                                    <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                                    <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p><strong>How to Care for Mounted Air Plants</strong></p>
                                                <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>

I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                                <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                                <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                                    <p>Hope this helps,<br>

                                                <div><p>@Laura – unfortunately these plants are highly susceptible to rot, and even being over-watered once is enough to trigger it. If the plant is falling apart, it’s probably not able to be saved. So sorry!</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

                                                <div><p>@Kelsey- Yikes! Sorry to hear about the mix-up. I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                                <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

                                                <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

                                                <div><p>@Corky – I think you can definitely hang it from your ceiling! I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                                <div><p>@ Cr8zyC8tL8dy – No shame on plant addiction! We’ve all been there (most of us still are there) and there’s something really satisfying about keeping these guys in your home and creating a bit of the tropics.</p>
                                                    <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                                    <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you. Check it out at: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

                                                <div><p>I moved into my first apartment with all these windows (facing east) and became addicted to air plants. I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

                                                <div><p>@Steph – Congrats on your air plant baby, otherwise known as a “pup!” How big was the mother plant? Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>
                                                    <p>In the case that it separated prematurely, I’d just do your best to be attentive to its needs, taking care not to over-or-under water, and making sure it gets bright, indirect light.</p>

                                                <div><p>@Emme – Congrats on your first air plant! These guys are very versatile, and the assembly can go a number of ways depending on your aesthetic preferences.</p>
                                                    <p>Generally, we recommend starting with sand/gravel and adding the larger items as you go, finishing with moss. Yes, the air plant goes in the container, but it simply rests on the surface of the stones. You don’t need to bury or “plant” it at all. Here’s a link to our aeriums as a reference: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/aerium</p>

We are confused as to the order of the packets we have to go into the glass container.  We have assembly direction, but not sure which goes where.  There is a packet with rock and moss and also a packet with fine grain gravel material. And does the air plant actually go into the container?  Just need some extra explanation please.

                                                    <p><strong>The name “<a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery">air plant</a>” is actually a bit misleading. Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                                    <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>
                                                    <p>Air plants are some of our very favorites; they are stunning as <a title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants">standalone pieces</a>, and we feature them in many of our <a title="Living Art - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art">Living Art</a> pieces, such as <a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a> and <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounts</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>Here are the best practices we recommend for air plant care. First we’ll talk about how to care for air plants in general, and then we’ll talk about adaptations in air plant care for aeriums, terrariums and mounted tillandsia.</p>

                                                    <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                                    <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                                    <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                                    <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                                    <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                                    <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                                    <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                                    <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                                    <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                                    <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                                    <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                                    <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>
                                                            <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                        <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                        <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                        <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                        <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                        <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                        <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <ul></ul>
                                                    <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                                    <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                                    <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                                    <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                                    <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                                    <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                                    <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                                    <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                                    <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                                        <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                        <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                                        <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                                        <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                                        <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p><strong>How to Care for Mounted Air Plants</strong></p>
                                                    <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>

                                                    <div><p>Hey! I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                                    <div><p>@Hayley – I think you’re right that the thinner, frizzier varieties tend to be a bit fussier and more susceptible to rot. I’d say if misting is working for you, stick with that!</p>

                                                    <div><p>@Dan – congrats! Your plant has reached maturity and flowered. They can look quite amazing during this. The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

                                                    <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                                    <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                                        <p>Hope this helps,<br>

                                                    <div><p>@Laura – unfortunately these plants are highly susceptible to rot, and even being over-watered once is enough to trigger it. If the plant is falling apart, it’s probably not able to be saved. So sorry!</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

                                                    <div><p>@Kelsey- Yikes! Sorry to hear about the mix-up. I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                                    <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

                                                    <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                                        <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                                        <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you.

I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>

                                                    <div><p>@Emme – Congrats on your first air plant! These guys are very versatile, and the assembly can go a number of ways depending on your aesthetic preferences.</p>
                                                        <p>Generally, we recommend starting with sand/gravel and adding the larger items as you go, finishing with moss. Yes, the air plant goes in the container, but it simply rests on the surface of the stones. You don’t need to bury or “plant” it at all. Here’s a link to our aeriums as a reference: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/aerium</p>
                                                        <p>Hope this helps!<br>

We are confused as to the order of the packets we have to go into the glass container.  We have assembly direction, but not sure which goes where.  There is a packet with rock and moss and also a packet with fine grain gravel material. And does the air plant actually go into the container?  Just need some extra explanation please.

Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                                        <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>

                                                        <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                                        <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                                        <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                                        <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                                        <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                                        <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                                        <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                                        <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                                        <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                                        <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                                        <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li>
                                                                <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                            <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                            <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                            <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                            <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                            <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                            <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <ul></ul>
                                                        <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                                        <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                                        <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                                        <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                                        <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                                        <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                                        <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                                        <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                                        <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                                        <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                        <br>
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                                            <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                            <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                                            <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                                            <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                                            </li>
                                                            <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                                            <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                                        </ul>

                                                        <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>

I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

                                                        <div><p>@Dan – congrats! Your plant has reached maturity and flowered. They can look quite amazing during this. The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

                                                        <div><p>I lve haf multiple airplants over the last couple year, honestly I don’t know what kind.  I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

                                                        <div><p>@Mya – brown tips on air plants usually indicates not enough water, though it sounds like you’re taking very astute care of your plants. You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>
                                                            <p>Hope this helps,<br>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

                                                        <div><p>@Sue – It’s normal that the exterior leaves can dry a bit and be shed, much like other tropical plants. However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

                                                        <div><p>@Ariel – It sounds like your air plant may not have been in good health when you purchased it. We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                                            <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                                            <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you.

                                                        <div><p>I moved into my first apartment with all these windows (facing east) and became addicted to air plants. I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                                            <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>

                                                            <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                                            <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                                            <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                                            <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                                            <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                                            <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                                            <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                                            <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>

                                                            <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                                            <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                                            <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                                            <ul>
                                                                <li>
                                                                    <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                                <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                                <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                                <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                                <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                                <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                                <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                                            </ul>
                                                            <ul></ul>
                                                            <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                                            <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                                            <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                                            <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                                            <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                                            <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                                            <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                                            <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                                            <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                                            <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                            <br>
                                                            <ul>
                                                                <li>Follow the care regimen outlined above - just remove your plant from the aerium, terrarium or glass in order to mist/soak it, and allow it to dry before replacing it in the glass</li>
                                                                <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                                <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>
                                                            </ul>
                                                            <p><em>If you cannot remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                            <ul>
                                                                <li>Since your plant won’t come out of the glass, you won’t be able to soak it and so will have to rely solely on misting. This is totally fine.</li>
                                                                <li>Small glass = less air circulation = longer drying time for plant = <b>less frequent misting</b>.</li>
                                                                <li>Large glass = more air circulation = shorter drying time for plant = <b>more frequent misting.</b>
                                                                </li>
                                                                <li>When misting your air plant, try to mist around the plant, rather than into the plant. You don’t want to over-water it, but rather to create a humid environment.</li>
                                                                <li>Depending on the vessel, we’d suggest starting by misting weekly, and adjusting as necessary.</li>
                                                            </ul>

                                                            <p>Like air plants in small glass vessels, you probably won’t be able to soak your <a title="Tillandsia Mount - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/tillandsia-wood-mount">mounted air plant</a>. However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting. We recommend starting with twice weekly misting, and adjusting as necessary, depending on how long it takes your plant to dry in your space.</p>

I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days.

The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

The outside leaves were brown and there is some yellow in the center surrounding leaves and the tips and the bottom were brown so I tried to pull the whole thing out but I ended up breaking some of the bottom green leaves off… So I soaked it for 10 mins and have it drying now… You think it will survive? I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                                                <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>

How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you.

I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>

                                                                <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                                                <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                                                <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                                                <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                                                <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                                                <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                                                <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                                                <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                                                <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                                                <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                                                <ul>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                                    <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                                    <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                                    <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                                    <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                                    <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                                    <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                                                </ul>
                                                                <ul></ul>
                                                                <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                                                <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                                                <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                                                <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                                                <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                                                <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                                                <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>

                                                                    <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                                    <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>

I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days.

The flower sticks around for quite a while before dying back. The plant will then hopefully produce “pups,” baby plantlets that eventually replace the mother.</p>

I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                                                    <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you.

I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner.

                                                                    <p>Generally, we recommend starting with sand/gravel and adding the larger items as you go, finishing with moss. Yes, the air plant goes in the container, but it simply rests on the surface of the stones. You don’t need to bury or “plant” it at all. Here’s a link to our aeriums as a reference: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/all/aerium</p>

We are confused as to the order of the packets we have to go into the glass container.  We have assembly direction, but not sure which goes where.  There is a packet with rock and moss and also a packet with fine grain gravel material. And does the air plant actually go into the container?  Just need some extra explanation please.

Members of the Tillandsia genus are so called not because they can thrive on air alone, but because they require no soil at all to grow. In fact, assuming that Tillandsia only need air to survive is one of the most common mistakes we see in air plant care.</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>In their natural habitat -- the forests, mountains and deserts of South and Central America -- air plants are epiphytic (growing on other plants without harming them), and emerge from the crooks and branches of trees.</p>

First we’ll talk about how to care for air plants in general, and then we’ll talk about adaptations in air plant care for aeriums, terrariums and mounted tillandsia.</p>
                                                                    <div data-accent_color="cccccc" data-background_color="ffffff" data-button_background_color="88b67a" data-button_text_color="ffffff" data-cart_button_text="Cart" data-cart_title="Your cart" data-cart_total_text="Total" data-checkout_button_text="Checkout" data-discount_notice_text="Shipping and discount codes are added at checkout." data-embed_type="cart" data-shop="pistils-nursery.myshopify.com" data-sticky="true" data-text_color="000000"></div>

                                                                    <p><strong>Light</strong></p>
                                                                    <p><em>How Much Light Does an Air Plant Need?</em></p>
                                                                    <p>In order to thrive, air plants need bright, indirect light. Rooms with southern or eastern facing windows make good candidates, because these spaces will be brightly illuminated with sun for most of the day. Rooms with north-facing windows work well, too, as long as the plant is placed close to the window, and the window isn’t blocked by trees or a neighboring apartment complex. Western light tends to come late in the day, and can be very hot and intense. Careful - you don’t want to fry your air plant!</p>
                                                                    <p>As a general rule of thumb, the higher the humidity in your space, the more light is tolerated by the air plant. This means that if you’re putting your air plant where it will receive loads of light, you should plan to mist it more often - twice a week or even daily. A sunny bathroom makes a happy home for an air plant, because the humidity from your shower will take care of most plant misting for you.</p>
                                                                    <p><em>Air Plants and Artificial Light</em></p>
                                                                    <p>Many people ask us if they can place their air plant in an office or basement room where it won’t get any natural light. The answer is yes, but there are a few specific rules to follow to ensure your plant’s success.</p>
                                                                    <p>Full spectrum (fluorescent) light is a must. Regular incandescent bulbs don’t emit the quality of light these plants need to photosynthesize. Your Tillandsia should be placed no further than 3 feet from the light source. Also if you’re going to use fluorescent light, the plants will need, at minimum, 12 hours per day.</p>
                                                                    <p>If you live in a basement or want to have an air plant in your office, we recommend buying a special bulb for your plant (such as a Gro-Lux, Repta-Sun or Vita-Lite) and setting it on a 12-hour timer, so your plant gets all the light it needs to survive.</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
                                                                    <p><em>How to Water an Air Plant</em></p>
                                                                    <p>Watering an air plant is the trickiest piece of the air plant care puzzle. Some people swear by misting, others by soaking, and still others use a combination of both misting and soaking in their air plant care regimen.</p>
                                                                    <p>In our experience, watering air plants is tricky because the needs of the plant vary dramatically with the space in which it is placed. The first step to watering your air plant is to evaluate your space. How much light is your plant receiving? What is the temperature in your home at this particular time of year? Is the space very dry (is your plant near a heater or fireplace?) Or is it very humid?</p>
                                                                    <p>After you answer these questions, you can adapt the air plant watering regimen to suit your particular needs. Here’s what we recommend as a starting point:</p>
                                                                    <ul>
                                                                        <li>
                                                                            <a href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants" title="Air Plants - Shop Tillandsia for Terrariums - Pistils Nursery"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/how-to-water-an-air-plant.jpg?2105" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="How to water an air plant" align="right"></a>Every three to four weeks, soak your air plant in room temperature tap water (or rain/pond water if you can find it) for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                                                                        <li>After soaking gently shake excess water from your plant. Turn it upside down and place it on a towel in a bright space. This is very important! Air plants will quickly rot if they are allowed to stand in excess water</li>
                                                                        <li>From the time soaking ends, the plant should be able to dry fully in no more than 4 hours. If your plant stays wet longer than this, it may rot. Try placing it in a brighter place with more air circulation to facilitate faster drying.</li>
                                                                        <li>1-3 hours is the optimal drying time for your air plant after soaking.</li>
                                                                        <li>Once a week, mist your plant thoroughly, so that the entire surface of the plant is moistened (but not so much that there is water dripping down into the plant).</li>
                                                                        <li>The hotter and dryer the air (summer, early fall) the more you need to water. The cooler and more humid the air (winter and spring) the less water your air plant will need. Remember, though, that heaters and fireplaces dry the air!</li>
                                                                        <li>Do all watering in the morning. Evening soaking or misting disrupts the plants ability to respire overnight, and extends drying time.</li>
                                                                    </ul>
                                                                    <ul></ul>
                                                                    <p><em>Is My Air Plant Getting Enough Water?</em></p>
                                                                    <p>Signs of under-watering your air plant include the leaf tips turning brown or crispy. The natural concave shape of air plant leaves tends to become more exaggerated when under-watered.</p>
                                                                    <p>Unfortunately, if your air plant has been over-watered, it’s often too late to save it. If the base of the plant turns brown or black, and leaves are falling out or off from the center, your plant has likely succumbed to rot.</p>
                                                                    <p>Air plants are pretty easygoing when it comes to their temperature. They do best between 50-90 degrees F. Ideally, overnight temperatures will be about 10 degrees cooler than daytime temperature.</p>
                                                                    <p>Incorporating orchid or Bromeliad fertilizer into your watering regimen once or twice a month is a great way to keep your air plant happy. Just add a pinch to your water and proceed as usual. Fertilizing your air plant encourages it to blossom and reproduce (or pup -- more on this later)</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>Air Plant Life Cycle</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>Did you know that air plants flower once in their life? Depending on the species, these blossoms last from a few days to a few months, and can be a whole variety of beautiful bright colors, like pink, red and purple. Flowering is the peak of the air plant life cycle, but also marks the beginning of the plant’s old age - after it flowers, the plant will eventually die.</p>
                                                                    <p>But don’t despair! Just before, during or after flowering, depending on the species, your air plant will reproduce by sending out 2-8 “pups”. These baby air plants, which start out very small, will eventually grow into their own mother plants. Pups can safely be separated from the mother plant when they’re about ⅓-½ its size. Careful not to remove them too early, as they’re actually receiving nutrients from the mother air plant!</p>
                                                                    <p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/5489/files/tillandsia-xerographica-with-brass-mister.jpg?2104" alt="Tillandsia Xerographica and Brass Plant Mister" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

                                                                    <p>While larger air plants standalone on a windowsill or tabletop, we love to include their smaller counterparts in our works of living art -- in fact, our “<a title="Aeriums - Pistils Nursery Web Shop" href="http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/living-art/aerium">aeriums</a>” are a special kind of terrarium dedicated entirely to air plants! Here’s what you need to know about caring for air plants in glass.</p>
                                                                    <p><em>If you can remove your air plant from it’s glass container:</em></p>
                                                                    <br>
                                                                    <ul>

                                                                        <li>Keep in mind that keeping your air plant in glass will create a micro-climate: Glass vessels will be more humid and hotter than the surrounding area.</li>
                                                                        <li>Take care not to put glass vessels too close to a window. Glass intensifies the rays of the sun. You don’t want to fry your plant!</li>

However, since they’re not contained to a humid, micro-climate like aeriums, mounted air plants will need even more frequent misting.

I have an ionatha Guatemalan air plant, and right now it has a baby plant growing on it and it has produced a flower a couple of months ago. However, the tips have become brown out of no where. I mist them twice a week, but I’m not sure if I’m overwatering. I also have 4 medusa air plants, and two of them are getting really curly, almost looks shriveled, but I give all of them the same amount of water. All my plants are on my east window, and I live in Miami, so I don’t know if I should underwater them right now since it’s constantly raining and not that much sunlight these days. Thank you</p></div>

I had a couple die when I soaked them a while ago and I atributed it to poor air flow and drying. However, recently I moved and my new apartment is super hot and dry. My roommate soaked my all our air plants for a few minutes and left them to dry sort of sideways because they wouldn’t stay upside down. Needless to say my airplants that have thinner and fuzzier leaves died again!  I’m curious why every site I look at recommends soaking all airplants? Are there certain varieties that should be soaked? I’ve had great luck misting so I guess I’ll stick to that routine but I was curious to your thoughts on this.</p></div>

You can clip off any brown, dry tips, and then might try watering just a bit more, while ensuring that they don’t get over-watered. If the dark base of the butzii feels mushy and leaves are falling apart, that would indicate rot – it’s quite difficult for them to recover from this.</p>

I try not misting it much since tectorum require less water than normal tilandsias. My juncea,xerographica, and harrisi also have brown tips . And my xerographica developed a brown spot is it ok? Also my butzi has a darkish colored base is this rot if so can I save it? The rest of the plant seems healthy . I water my air plants 2-3x I’m a soak for 10 mins except The tectorum which I must 2x a week I live in Colorado where the air is for the most part dry  should I water more or less? And tips?</p></div>

However, since I’ve been home from school, I’m not sure what happened. I’ve been misting the same as I did at school, possibly a little more because there’s AC on in the house which dries everything out. I didn’t realize that the water was pooling in the bottom of the globe the plant’s in (although it probably did at school too?) and now I think my plant is rotting! A good number of the leaves fell off when I held the plant vertically; the ones that are left are still brown at the base but not as bad. Is there any way to save my plant?</p></div>

I can’t say I’ve ever had this experience before, so I’m not sure how the plants will or will not recover from the hot bath. I’d try to keep their care as normal/stable as possible over the next few weeks and just see how they respond. It would probably be best to hold off on selling them until you’re sure they’re going to make it. If they haven’t fallen away in 2-3 weeks, you should be safe!</p>

However, just be sure that you’re not overwatering – are the bottom leaves turning brown/mushy at the base? If not, I’d clip off the dried out leaves and see how the rest of the plant reacts. It may also benefit from more light or additional misting, depending on your space.</p>

We like to avoid gluing our air plants, as it makes proper watering pretty difficult (though it can certainly be done!) That said, the brown/yellow leaves and tips might mean it was allowed to dry out too much. But as far as care goes, you did the right thing. It will take some time to show you if it’s recovering or not, but just try to keep it stable and happy and see if the condition improves! As far as identification goes, there are many air plants with red tips, but it could be an ionantha guatemala. Check out pictures here: shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

I pulled all the remaining bottom with glue out of the container so it’s clean for the plant once it drys. Also to identify maybe,? it has long spiny leaves and the center has red in the tips</p></div>

I think the easiest way would be to create a loop around the base of the plant with fishing line, and then attach that to a hook or nail in the ceiling. You’ll have to take it down to water, but other than that, your care regimen shouldn’t change too much.</p>

                                                                    <div><p>@ Cr8zyC8tL8dy – No shame on plant addiction! We’ve all been there (most of us still are there) and there’s something really satisfying about keeping these guys in your home and creating a bit of the tropics.</p>
                                                                        <p>It sounds like there’s a number of things possibly going on. When you describe the plants turning black at the bottom and smelling funny, that is most definitely over-watering, which is a quick-killer of air plants. Try following the care regimen outlined above, and be sure to place air plants in a place where they’ll get good air circulation after they are soaked. They need to dry within 3 hours, otherwise they can rot! If you’re having trouble getting them to dry fast enough, try putting a fan on them after soaking. Dry and brittle sounds like periodic misting is necessary. Make sure they’re not getting blasted by a heater, which can really dry them out quickly.</p>
                                                                        <p>Lastly, it is possible that your plants are getting to you already unhealthy. How quickly after you buy them do they typically fall apart? We have a nice selection of plants up on our web shop, if you’d like to try us out. If you’re after a particular species, we have more than what’s listed in our retail store and can put something custom together for you. Check it out at: http://shop.pistilsnursery.com/collections/air-plants</p>

I won’t even begin to admit how much money I spent on plants or decorative mounts. Don’t even try and guess, I’ll simply deny! However, I’m a certified air plant killer. Well, first my cat was, so I had to buy a few new plants, which led to more plants… and move them all to higher spots and get creative in displaying them where kitties couldn’t feast. Then, some would get dry and brittle. Others, the leaves all turned brown. Some the bases turned black and smelled funny and fell apart. And some were so delicate I got a little over zealous and the bulbs just broke off?! Clearly, I should probably put the credit card away (I think it’s maxed anyway), give away the few plants that are still living, and just walk away, but they’re so… cool! Just tonight I had to mourn the loss of about a dozen plants (I said I was addicted!). I don’t know if it’s the suppliers (I mean it’d be great if it wasn’t me, right?), the environment (Pacific NW), my apartment (lighting, air…), or… (not me, not me!). Please don’t ask me to list which ones I’ve bought, if they exist, I either have them or I’ve killed them. Or maybe I’m just tossing perfectly good, healthy plants because I really have no idea what I’m doing! Save me!</p></div>

Generally, they will fall off on their own when the time is right, usually when they’re about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, but sometimes sooner. There’s also lots of variation between species, so you might be just fine!</p>
